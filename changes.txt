	- CHANGE: Adjust a "radius" circle on MQ2Map to depict the Radius engage
	- CHANGE: Added /farm command param "ShowSettings" to display all valid settings.

		target consideration, and the user should not select entities outside of that circle when farming.
	- CHANGE: Added the /permignore command to replicate the usage in the macro
	- CHANGE: Added DeathChecks and Missing Group members checks. These are the same thing as far as the plugin is concerned.

	- CHANGE: Tell user about the "/farm help" command on initilize.
	- CHANGE: "/farm off" doesn't turn off attack if it's on? Bug or feature? Check for aggro, if none, turn off
		attack, otherwise leave it on?
	- CHANGE: Add a message to let the user know there are no valid targets nearby and you are sitting while waiting for more.

2019-01-22: Chatwiththisname
	- CHANGE: Fixed a typo in setting the ignore file, changed from FarmMobIgnores.ini to FarmMobIgnored.ini

2019-01-20: Chatwiththisname
	- Added the use of the FarmMobIgnored.ini file in the macro folder for the global ignores
		so players didn't need to reinvent the wheel and could use the existing ignores file.
	- Added group health mana and endurance checks so you can now have the merc tag along
		without worry of running them out of mana.

	- DiscReady function now makes sure you aren't trying to use an active disc when you already have one running.
	- Added usage of Instant cast beneficial buffs while in combat.
	- Made a HUD for use with the ${Farm.TargetID} to get a display of what it's going after and some information, useful for debugging. :-)
	- You can now add and remove Discs with INI entries. [DiscRemove] section for removing. [DiscAdd] section for Additions.
